# network-services
A Pulumi definition for deploying Holochain network services to be used for development

## Development

### Installation

First, make sure that you are in the Nix development shell or that you have
installed `pulumi`, `pulumi-language-go`, and `go`.

Then, log into Pulumi with:
```sh
pulumi login
```

Next, set the default organisation to `holochain` with:
```sh
pulumi org set-default holochain
```

Finally, select the Pulumi stack that you want to use. For this repo it is `network-services`.
```sh
pulumi stack select network-services
```

### Making changes

Then preview the changes with:
```sh
pulumi preview
```

### Applying changes

Simply open a PR to see the preview of the changes in the CI. Then, once the PR
is reviewed and merged into the `main` branch, a new workflow will push the
changes to Pulumi.

## Changing the DigitalOcean token

Pulumi requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) for DigitalOcean to make calls to the API.

Currently, the PAT is linked to the `ThetaSinner` DigitalOcean user account. To
change the token, run the following command:
```sh
pulumi config set --secret digitalocean:token <new-token>
```

This value is encrypted by Pulumi and stored in [Pulumi.network-services.yaml].

Remember to open a PR with the new token and allow the CI/Actions to apply the
changes to Pulumi.
